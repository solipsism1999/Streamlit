The story begins on a clear, moonlit night. Aiko is on her balcony, observing the constellations with her telescope, as she does every night. Unexpectedly, she spots Hiroshi on his own balcony, staring up at the same moon and stars. Aiko can't help but be captivated by the sight of him lost in thought, his usually charismatic demeanor replaced by something more vulnerable. She realizes that Hiroshi has a hidden love for astronomy as well, a shared passion they've never discussed. Aiko takes a deep breath and gathers her courage, deciding to approach Hiroshi. She sends him a message, asking if he'd like to join her for some stargazing. At first, Hiroshi is taken aback by the message from Aiko, the enigmatic girl from their school who he's admired from afar. However, his curiosity and love for the stars compel him to accept her invitation. As they share the moonlit balcony and gaze at the night sky, Aiko and Hiroshi bond over their shared passion for astronomy. They discuss constellations, the beauty of the cosmos, and their dreams. With each passing moment, they become closer, and a romantic connection begins to bloom beneath the stars.\n",

    "Characters: Aiko Nakamura: Aiko is a 17-year-old high school student with long, midnight-black hair and striking amethyst eyes. She's introverted, passionate about astronomy, and often seen with her telescope. She has a quiet, mysterious aura and a tendency to stargaze at night.\n",
    "Hiroshi Tanaka: Hiroshi is an 18-year-old classmate of Aiko's, known for his outgoing and carefree personality. He has messy, sun-kissed hair and deep green eyes. He's a soccer player and the school's popular guy, often surrounded by friends.\n",
    "Aiko Nakamura, a girl who lives in the world of stars and constellations, finds herself secretly in love with Hiroshi Tanaka, the school heartthrob who is always surrounded by adoring fans. The story begins on a clear, moonlit night. Aiko is on her balcony, observing the constellations with her telescope, as she does every night. Unexpectedly, she spots Hiroshi on his own balcony, staring up at the same moon and stars. Aiko can't help but be captivated by the sight of him lost in thought, his usually charismatic demeanor replaced by something more vulnerable. She realizes that Hiroshi has a hidden love for astronomy as well, a shared passion they've never discussed. Aiko takes a deep breath and gathers her courage, deciding to approach Hiroshi. She sends him a message, asking if he'd like to join her for some stargazing. At first, Hiroshi is taken aback by the message from Aiko, the enigmatic girl from their school who he's admired from afar. However, his curiosity and love for the stars compel him to accept her invitation. As they share the moonlit balcony and gaze at the night sky, Aiko and Hiroshi bond over their shared passion for astronomy. They discuss constellations, the beauty of the cosmos, and their dreams. With each passing moment, they become closer, and a romantic connection begins to bloom beneath the stars.\n",
